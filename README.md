# VisionTransformer
Implementing the VisionTransformer paper for fun and learning.
The relevant papers are [An Image is worth 16x16 words](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf) and [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf).

Implementation is still WIP and only meant for personal learning. It is based on [this](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/blob/master/timm/models/vision_transformer.py).
